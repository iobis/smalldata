# User testing summary 

## Dashboard
* Change wording for title with table 
* Maybe add third option, split up adding / overview? 
* Help page with explanation for the datasets being added by node managers + contact node manager option 

## General remarks
* excel upload possibility? -> IPT
* Catch the enter key on the entire page -> submit record? Not in every step!! consistency 
* Back button (browser) needs to go to previously active step 


## Input dataset
* search for dataset? Paging? How many datasets will there be?? 

## Occurrence data
* use different component for date: time is not possible, manual editing of date is not possible and lots of people clicked the calendar icon 
* set date in locale format 
* wording for basis of record is confusing. Are "Human field observation" and "Musuem living specimen" acceptable alternatives? 
* Validate mandatory fields when moving to next step 

## Location data 
* Make location lookup larger / more prominent / different location. They don't see the button. Actual tool works well! 
* Make current location center of map when loading 
* Add more verbatim data examples "Off the coast of Plymouth" 

## Observation data
* Change wording to "metadata"
* break up data in different sections 
* different graphical layout + add button for elements with multiple values. People don't notice it can have multiple values

## Measurement or fact 
* Add functionality that if person forgets to click add button, it shows a modal with suggesting to add the fields 
* People don't notice the copy button, but leave it anyway 
* Animate adding a measurement or fact / test it on smaller screens. Sticky? 
* 

## Darwin core 
* Possibility of auto suggestion list 
* Link to existing field list(s)
* Validate for spaces? 

## Extra suggestions 
* Upload images? 
* When someone is not a biologist but a naturalist is it important to know his / her affiliation or base / location of operation?
