# User testing summary 

## Dashboard
* Change wording for title with table 
* Maybe add third option, split up adding / overview? 
* Help page with explanation for the datasets being added by node managers + contact node manager option 

## General remarks
* excel upload possibility? -> IPT
* Catch the enter key on the entire page -> submit record? Not in every step!! consistency 
* Back button (browser) needs to go to previously active step 


## Input dataset
* search for dataset? Paging? How many datasets will there be?? 

## Occurrence data
* use different component for date: time is not possible, manual editing of date is not possible and lots of people clicked the calendar icon 
* set date in locale format 
* wording for basis of record is confusing. Are "Human field observation" and "Musuem living specimen" acceptable alternatives? 
* Validate mandatory fields when moving to next step 

## Location data 
* Make location lookup larger / more prominent / different location. They don't see the button. Actual tool works well! 
* Make current location center of map when loading 
* Add more verbatim data examples "Off the coast of Plymouth" 

## Observation data
* Change wording to "metadata"
* break up data in different sections - from Abby:
  >   Hi Jill and Kurt,

  >   If you look at the Darwin Core reference guide, you'll see that things like institution code and collection code fall under the "Record-level" header whereas catalog number and record number fall under "Occurrence" and identified by and recorded by fall under "Identification". Even though I know the biologist won't know about Darwin Core it might make sense to keep these kinds of headers in place since they already exist and it helps build that connection in the biologist's mind without having to have them learn Darwin Core themselves.

* different graphical layout + add button for elements with multiple values. People don't notice it can have multiple values

## Measurement or fact 
* Add functionality that if person forgets to click add button, it shows a modal with suggesting to add the fields 
* People don't notice the copy button, but leave it anyway 
* Animate adding a measurement or fact / test it on smaller screens. Sticky? 
* 

## Darwin core 
* Possibility of auto suggestion list 
* Link to existing field list(s)
* Validate for spaces? 

## Extra suggestions 
* Upload images? 
* When someone is not a biologist but a naturalist is it important to know his / her affiliation or base / location of operation?
